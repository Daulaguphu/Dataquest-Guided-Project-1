    "From these lists, we can assume that for these 3 application genres on App Store is highly influenced by big player, such as :  Waze, Google Maps, Facebook, Pinterest, Skype, Pandora, Spotify, Shazam, etc. This probably makes number of ratings given for these categories is skewed mostly by these well-known and wide-used apps. This pattern also can give us some hints that these three categories may not really popular than they are because the number of user's rating is mostly from those big player apps. Therefore, we can remove these three categories from our assumption for most common apps. Besides, if we create app in one of those three categories, we may have struggle to conquer those well-known apps."

The application will focus on user's engagement as its main source of revenues by displaying in-app advertisements and this application will also be free and for English-speaking users. For our analysis, we use Google Play Store and Apple App Store datasets containing records of applications available in both markets. \n",
